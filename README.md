# Doxygen
This repository contains code for an assignment focused on expanding your documentation toolkit using Doxygen. The assignment involves documenting multiple classes representing employees in a company hierarchy.

## Assignment Overview
The assignment tasks include:
1. Creating Doxygen configuration files.
2. Documenting the provided Employee, Officer, and Supervisor classes.
3. Generating HTML documentation using Doxygen.

## Assignment Components
The repository consists of the following components:
- **Employee.h, Employee.cpp**: Files containing the declaration and implementation of the Employee class.
- **Officer.h, Officer.cpp**: Files containing the declaration and implementation of the Officer class, which inherits from the Employee class.
- **Supervisor.h, Supervisor.cpp**: Files containing the declaration and implementation of the Supervisor class, which also inherits from the Employee class.
- **doxyConfig**: Doxygen configuration file.

## Getting Started
To complete the assignment, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Review the provided code files: Employee.h, Employee.cpp, Officer.h, Officer.cpp, Supervisor.h, and Supervisor.cpp.
3. Create Doxygen configuration files based on the provided instructions.
4. Document the classes and their methods using Doxygen-compatible comment syntax.
5. Generate HTML documentation using Doxygen.

## Challenges
1. It was a little tricky trying to get doxygen to work
2. Not necessarily a major challenge, but it took longer than expected to document all the files
